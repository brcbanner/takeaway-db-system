## CONCEPTUAL DESIGN

## Sample Owner Request
A chain of takeaway sandwich shops, which has locations in the main cities of Italy, needs a well-organized database to handle info about customers, orders, workers, inventory, and shops.

For each customer, their personal info is recorded, including first name, last name, age, email, tax code, phone number, _address_, and maybe the _floor_.

The staff at each _point of sale_ is divided into different categories (like cleaning staff, sandwich makers, packaging people). For each worker, the first name, last name, phone number, and _the details of documents needed for hiring_ are saved. Other useful info for staff is also stored, like professional title, type of contract (fixed-term or permanent), _salary_, work area, _contract period_ (for fixed-term contracts), and past employment. For _people who work independently_, it's a bit different: they have a VAT number and are not tied to a specific _store_.

Any worker, whether employed or independent, can also be a customer.

The chain has only one _store_ per city. Each _point of sale_ is recorded via an _address_; it has its own staff and an inventory made of the ingredients needed to make sandwiches. Every ingredient is tracked with a unique code, name, category (like meat, fish, vegetables, etc.), _unit price_, expiration date, and _available amount_.

Sandwiches themselves have a unique code, a name, a description, and a _price_. Each order, requested by a customer, is delivered by a rider from a specific _store_. Orders are tracked with a unique code and the _total order price_. Delivery has a _price_ that changes depending on the delivery type (for ‚Äústandard‚Äù the price doesn‚Äôt change, for ‚Äúexpress‚Äù it‚Äôs 3 euros more) and _distance_ (every kilometer increases the price by 20 cents). Each order is linked to a payment transaction with a payment code and method. For each stage of the order (request, delivery, and payment), date and time are recorded.

## Requirements Analysis
This text presents a number of ambiguities and imprecisions. At this stage, it is important to:

- **Avoid overly generic terms**, which make a concept unclear, and replace them with more meaningful ones or define them clearly 
  - `Address` ‚Üí address including region, province, street (street or square), postal code, and street number  
  - `Floor` ‚Üí floor number  
  - `Details of documents required for hiring` ‚Üí tax code and ID card number, or alternatively passport number  
  - `Contract period` ‚Üí employment start and end dates  
  - `Available amount` ‚Üí available weight  
  - `Distance` ‚Üí distance between the delivery address (customer residence) and the store from which the order is sent  

- **Simplify convoluted sentences** that make the text difficult to understand
  - `People who work independently` ‚Üí freelance workers

- **Identify synonyms and homonyms** to clarify ambiguities
  - `Store` and `point of sale` ‚Üí `location` 

- **Make references between terms explicit**
  - `Freelance workers` ‚Üí riders

- **Indicate the unit of measurement** for all quantities 
  - `Unit price` ‚Üí euro per kg or euro ??
  - `Available weight` ‚Üí kilograms
  - `Distance` ‚Üí kilometers
  - `Price` and `total order price` ‚Üí euro
